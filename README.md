COVID Accessory. A virtual  RING FOR SERVICE BELL for your Android phone.  


RING FOR SERVICE BELL

Due to covid, my local supermarket's deli counter is short staffed.
They first put a "ring for service" bell on the counter to let staff know
there was a customer when they were working in the back.

You know,  an annoying ding, ding, ding thing.

But the bell was removed after someone complained they had to TOUCH it
and it may not be sanitary or safe to do so. That's the story anyway. 
Staff may have just gotten sick of the  bell.

So you stand and wait and wait or lose your place in line as you go to yell at the door
while someone else walks up to the designated "wait here "dot.



So now, there's an app for that too!
